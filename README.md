# Calum Medlock's Portfolio

## Introduction

On this webpage, you can preview various website projects that I have completed. I approached the development of this webpage with a mobile-first design, using media queries to adjust for tablet and desktop versions. This made my workload easier as it allowed me to focus on building the webpage for mobile devices first and then scaling it up for larger screens.

I also made sure to prioritise accessibility and followed WCAG 2.1 standards in the development of this webpage. This ensures that the webpage is accessible to users with disabilities and meets industry standards for usability.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio webpage. I hope you find it useful in learning more about my work as a web consultant. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential website projects.

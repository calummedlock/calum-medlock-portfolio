      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a web consultant, I have a strong track record of helping businesses improve their online presence. I am
        particularly skilled in driving traffic and generating leads, and I have a keen eye for design
        and user experience. In addition to my technical expertise, I am also deeply committed to creating accessible
        websites
        that can be used and enjoyed by everyone, regardless of their ability or disability.</p>
      <p>As a Deaf individual, I have a unique perspective on the importance of accessibility in web design. I
        understand firsthand the barriers that can exist for people with disabilities, and I am passionate about working
        to remove those barriers. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to access and engage with the
        content and resources on the web, and I work tirelessly to ensure that my websites are designed with this goal
        in mind. My dedication to accessibility sets me apart as a web consultant, and is a testament to my commitment
        to inclusivity and diversity.</p>
